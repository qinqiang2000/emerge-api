## What each milestone delivers

### M2C — autoresearch + /improve

**Goal:** the user types `/improve`, the agent loops `max_turn` times proposing schema description tweaks, scoring against reviewed, picking the best candidate. Output is a candidate ProjectVersion under `versions/_candidate/{job_id}/`; user must explicitly accept (no auto-promote, per spec red line).

**Scope:**
- `emerge-autoresearch` SKILL.md (loaded on `/improve`)
- JobRunner: asyncio queue + JSONL event stream + pause/resume/cancel
- Background tool calls: `start_job(skill, params) → job_id`, `tail_job(job_id)` (SSE), `pause_job/resume_job/cancel_job`
- Counterexample regression set (from `_notes` in reviewed) feeds proposer LLM
- Frontend: streaming progress UI in chat (per-turn F1 update), pause button while job running
- Spec deferred items to fold in: type-derived field controls (FieldEditor), `_source_page` evidence trace, inline `_notes` UI, multi-page PDF probe (already done in M2B), `_evidence` round-trip on review save

**Tech notes:** proposer LLM uses provider adapter (separate from agent SDK). Default proposer model = same as extract_model. Bound by `max_turn` (e.g. 30) and `early_stop_no_improvement` (e.g. 5). No token / $ budget — lab side per spec §4.4.

### M3 — publish + prod fast-path + API key

**Goal:** `/publish` freezes a `versions/v{n}.json`, issues an API key, and serves `POST /v1/{pid}/extract` as a deterministic fast-path (no agent loop, just provider call).

**Scope:**
- `emerge-publish` SKILL.md (loaded on `/publish`)
- Tools: `freeze_version`, `readiness_check`, `contract_diff`, `issue_api_key`
- Prod fast-path FastAPI router on `/v1/{pid}/extract` — auth via per-project API key from `workspace/_keys.json` (hashed)
- One-time API key reveal modal in chat
- case2 entry: client feedback adds field → propose schema diff → user accepts → re-extract → save_reviewed → /eval → /publish v2 (additive contract diff passes)
- Backward-compat contract diff: added fields ok; removed/type-changed/enum-narrowed → reject

### M4 — polish

**Goal:** what's left before merge.

**Scope:**
- Dark mode aligned with Anthropic palette
- Real-LLM smoke CI (cheap model, warn-only)
- Tool-failure UX (red card, retry, error_code copy)
- Export bundle: `schema.json` + `curl` example + `readme.md`
- Verify inline comments → autoresearch hint loop end-to-end
- Address remaining minors from M2A/M2B reviewer reports

### M5 — UX papercut bundle

**Goal:** absorb four follow-ups deferred from M4 — `useJob` per-`jobId` isolation, ReviewMode schema cache invalidated by chat events, multi-entity `score()` / `readiness` / `FieldEditor`, and click-a-field-to-jump-to-page in ReviewMode.

**Scope:** see `2026-05-09-m5-ux-papercut.md`. No new spec scope; closes follow-ups #1, #2, #3, #8 from "Open cross-cutting follow-ups".

## Open cross-cutting follow-ups

These don't fit a milestone but should be tracked:

- ~~**Multi-entity docs**~~ — closed by M5 (`score()` walks all entities; `FieldEditor` renders per-entity row groups; `useReview` holds `entities: dict[]`). `readiness_check` was already multi-entity-correct via score-delegation; M5 added a discriminating regression test.
- ~~**`_evidence` round-trip on review save**~~ — closed by M5: backend round-trip was already wire-correct; M5 added the click-to-page UX (a `pN` badge per evidenced field jumps `PdfViewer.goPage`).
- ~~**`fetchSchema` in ReviewMode is a one-shot fetch**~~ — closed by M5: ReviewMode reads from a `useSchema` Zustand store with `invalidate(pid)`.
- ~~**Cross-store refresh on agent tool events**~~ — closed by M5: `useChat.handleToolResult` invalidates `useSchema` / refreshes `useDocs` / `useProjects` on relevant tool completions; `ChatPanel.onSubmit`'s manual refresh hack is gone. Post-M5 dogfood (multi_entity_2.pdf, 2026-05-10) extended the trigger list to also cover `extract_batch` / `extract_one` (PENDING → DRAFT) and `freeze_version` (active version bump).
- **🚨 Critical: agent allowlist not enforcing on SDK built-in tools** — found 2026-05-10 during M5 dogfood. `chat/service.py:_emerge_only_permission` is wired with `permission_mode='default'` + `can_use_tool` callback + `allowed_tools=['mcp__emerge_tools__*']`, but `chats/c_*.jsonl` shows `Glob` calls with `ok: true` returning real workspace paths (`workspace/p_4w6rzeuz9dfi/docs/...`, `.tmp_workspace/...`). The deny callback is not being invoked for SDK built-ins. Worst case: Read on `backend/.env` / Bash arbitrary commands. Single-user lab so threat-model is "agent could leak our own files to itself" — risk-bounded but **not acceptable** for any hosted / multi-tenant. Investigation needed: whether the SDK's `permission_mode='default'` exempts certain tool classes, or whether `disallowed_tools=[<built-ins>]` is required, or whether the SDK version we use respects the callback at all.
- **Audit log for `/v1/{pid}/extract` calls** — M3 only updates `last_used` per row. Deferred: per-call JSONL under `audit/{date}.jsonl` with hash prefix + ts + outcome. Useful once a project has multiple consumers.
- **Plaintext API key leaks into `chats/{chat_id}.jsonl`** — found by M3 real-LLM smoke (chrome-devtools-mcp, 2026-05-09). Two surfaces: (a) chat-log writer persists the raw `tool_result` SSE event for `issue_api_key` including `key_plaintext`, (b) the LLM's natural-language summary often quotes the plaintext despite the skill's "NEVER include" instruction. Spec §12.6 marks this as a hard rule, but emerge is a single-user lab tool — the keys are minted to call our own `/v1` for testing, threat model is just local-fs read by the same user. **Risk-accepted for now**; revisit before any multi-tenant / hosted deployment. Fix when revisited: server-side redact `tool_result` for `mcp__emerge_tools__issue_api_key` before append + regex-scrub `ek_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{32}` from `agent_text` events both before persist and before SSE send; one-time history scrubber for existing jsonls.
- **Workspace-wide flock for `_keys.json`** — M3 `issue_api_key` locks per-pid only; concurrent issuance for *different* pids races on the shared file. Single-user lab is fine; defer fix until multi-tenant.
- ~~**`useJob` is a single global Zustand store**~~ — closed by M5: `useJob.byId[jobId]` per-slice state with `AbortController` abort-on-resubscribe; `JobProgressCard` reads the slice via selector.
- **Per-tool retry endpoint** — M4 ships chat-level "重试上一条" only. Per-tool re-run needs `/lab/chat/retry-tool` keyed by prior `tool_use_id`, plus frontend splice semantics for replacing the failed pill result without replaying the full user turn.
- **Export bundle filename for non-ASCII project names** — M4 `_safe_filename` strips non-ASCII, so a Chinese project name falls back toward `project-vN.zip`. Decide whether to preserve RFC 5987 `filename*=` UTF-8 names or use a deterministic ASCII slug with project id suffix.

## How to use this file

1. **Before starting a plan**: read this file to know what comes next.
2. **After shipping a plan**: update the row's status to ✅ + commit range. Move the milestone to the bottom of "What each milestone delivers" only if scope evolved during execution.
3. **When a follow-up is identified**: add a bullet to "Open cross-cutting follow-ups". Don't silently fold it into the next milestone — the visibility matters.
4. **When writing the next plan**: open `superpowers:writing-plans` skill, target the milestone listed under "What each milestone delivers", produce a plan file under this same directory dated YYYY-MM-DD.
